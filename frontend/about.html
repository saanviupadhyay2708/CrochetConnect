      <p class="about-story">
        What started as a quiet hobby quickly turned into healing.
        In the middle of lifeâ€™s everyday chaos, my mom â€” lovingly known as Minu â€” picked up a crochet needle out of curiosity. Little did she know that what began as a simple search for a creative outlet would soon become her favorite form of therapy. Each loop, knot, and stitch became more than just a craft â€” it became comfort, calm, and connection.<br><br>
        CrochetConnect was born from her hands, her heart, and her healing.<br>
        From cozy caps to intricate tops, from tiny toys to textured patterns, every piece is handmade with intention and love â€” often while sipping chai and listening to her favorite music.<br><br>
        This platform is more than just a store â€” itâ€™s a tribute to handmade art, to mothers who inspire, and to the quiet magic that happens when passion meets purpose.<br><br>
